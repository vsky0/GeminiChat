# Gemini Chat: A Django Web App

This project builds a web application similar to the interface you use to interact with large language models (LLMs) like me, Gemini. It utilizes Django, the Gemini API, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview

* **Goal**: Create a user interface for interacting with an LLM through the Gemini API.

* **Functionality**: Users can submit prompts and receive responses processed by the real Gemini LLM.

## **Technology Stack**

* **Backend**: Django (Python Web Framework)
* **API**: Gemini API
* **Frontend**: HTML(Structure), CSS(Styling), JavaScript(Optional for Interactivity)

## **Features**

User input for prompts and questions. (# Bullet points can be created using asterisks (*))

Interaction with the Gemini API to send prompts and receive LLM responses.

Displaying LLM responses on the user interface.

## **Considerations**

Public APIs might not expose the full capabilities of the real Gemini.

User authentication and authorization might be needed for specific functionalities.

Error handling and user feedback are crucial for a good user experience.

## **Learning Outcomes**
Gaining experience with Django web development.

Learning how to interact with APIs.

Building user interfaces with HTML and CSS.


**Note**: Accessing powerful LLMs might have limitations or require specific permissions. This project focuses on educational purposes and demonstrating concepts, not replicating the full Gemini functionality.
